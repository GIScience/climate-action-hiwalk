This tool calculates a Walkability-Index for a given area based on a set of indicators.
Walkability is defined as a combination of the ability to traverse a given road section by foot (i.e. "Can I walk here?") and the comfort during the trip (i.e. "Do I want to walk here?").

The features of this prototype are currently limited.
