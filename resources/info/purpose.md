The Walkability module provides a collection of indicators related to a number of different aspects that determine the perceived quality (safety, comfort, practicality) of walking along a given street or within a given area of interest. In the future, the module will combine the different indicators into a general walkability index.

Currently available are:

* A categorisation of walkable paths based on which other road users share the path with pedestrians (such as bicycles and motorised traffic).
* A grading of the paths' surface quality based on its reported smoothness or surface type.
* A connectivity measure based on the reachability of other paths within a defined area of interest.
