The indicators are based on the [OpenStreetMap (OSM)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about) database.
OSM is a free and open geo-database often called the "Wikipedia of maps".
It is a feature-rich collection of e.g. streets and paths maintained by voluntary contributors.

Detailed explanations on the methods can be found in the description of each indicator.

# Path categories

HiWalk categorises paths according to which other users share space with pedestrians (e.g., bikes,
motorized traffic). The table below describes each category.

| Category Name                         | Description                                                                    |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Designated**                        | Pedestrians have a designated path (e.g. roads with sidewalks)                 |
| **Shared with bikes**                 | Pedestrians share the path with cyclists, but no motorised traffic             |
| **Shared with slow cars**             | Pedestrians share the path with or are close to slow motorised traffic         |
| **Shared with medium speed cars**     | Pedestrians share the path with medium speed motorised traffic (up to 30 km/h) |
| **Shared with fast cars**             | Pedestrians share the path with fast motorised traffic (up to 50 km/h)         |
| **Shared with cars of unknown speed** | Pedestrians share the path with motorised traffic whose speed is unknown       |
| **Not walkable**                      | Streets deemed too dangerous to walk on or with forbidden access               |
| **Unknown**                           | Insufficient information to classify (e.g. missing sidewalk tag)               |
