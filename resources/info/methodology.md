The indicators are based on the [OpenStreetMap (OSM)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about) database.
OSM is a free and open geo-database often called the "Wikipedia of maps".
It is a feature-rich collection of e.g. streets and paths maintained by voluntary contributors.

Detailed explanations on the methods can be found in the description of each indicator.
