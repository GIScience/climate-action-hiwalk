Steep slopes or large amounts of moderate slopes reduce the accessibility of an area for some pedestrians and wheelchair
users.
This indicator estimates the slope of OSM paths based on the elevation at the start and end point using
the [openelevationservice](https://github.com/GIScience/openelevationservice).
The underlying data uses a 90x90m SRTM grid which may create unexpected results for short paths.
Paths are colored based on Alves et al. (2020) slope bins.
