Connectivity of path segments:

The map shows how accessible the locations surrounding each path are. High connectivity for a given path means a high share of the surrounding paths can be reached in the maximum trip duration.

More specifically, we define connectivity as the proportion of accessible locations out of the total number of locations in an area of interest (AOI). The AOI includes all the road intersections that can be reached from a given point traveling at the walking speed for the maximum trip duration in a straight line ("as the crow flies"). A target location is considered accessible if the actual walking distance through the street network is smaller or equal to the radius of the AOI.

When calculating connectivity, it is possible to take into account that people are more likely to walk shorter rather than longer distances, and therefore give more weight to closer locations. For more details see the description below.
