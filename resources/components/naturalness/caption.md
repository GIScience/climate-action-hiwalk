How much natural greenness is there along my path?

This map presents a categorisation of paths based on the extent of greenness within 10m of the path.
Green streets have several benefits that encourage people to walk more, such as:
providing shade and protection from the sun and heat,
improving stormwater drainage to mitigate local flooding potential,
and increasing the amenity of streets for walking.
