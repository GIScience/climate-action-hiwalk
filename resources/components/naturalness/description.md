Greenness scores each path based on the presence of vegetation within 15 m from the center of a path or road, reflecting the environment perceived by pedestrians.

To assess vegetation, we calculate the median of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery (available at 10-m resolution) across the area of buffered paths. NDVI helps to quantify the health and density of vegetation by measuring how much light is reflected in the red and near-infrared spectral bands.

Vegetation promotes walking by making streets more attractive, providing shade, and reducing flooding through better stormwater drainage.
