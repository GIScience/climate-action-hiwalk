Naturalness scores each path based on the presence of vegetation and water bodies within 15 m from the center of a path or road, reflecting the environment perceived by pedestrians. Users can also assess naturalness based on only vegetation or water.

To assess vegetation, we calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery (available at 10-m resolution). NDVI helps to quantify the health and density of vegetation by measuring how much light is reflected in the red and near-infrared spectral bands.

Green streets (i.e., with high NDVI values) have several benefits that encourage people to walk more, such as:

- providing shade,
- improving stormwater drainage and thereby mitigating local flooding risk,
- making streets prettier and more attractive.


We assess the presence of water bodies (i.e., blueness) based on the Sentinel Scene Classification Map (SCL).

Similar to green paths, paths with nearby water bodies tend to be more attractive and pleasant to walk on.
