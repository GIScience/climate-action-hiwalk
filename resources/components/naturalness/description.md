How is 'Naturalness' calculated?

Naturalness scores each path accounting for the presence of vegetation (NDVI) and water bodies within 15 m from the center of a path or road, reflecting the environment perceived by pedestrians. Users also have the option to compute the naturalness assessment for only either vegetation (greenness) or water (blueness).

For assessing vegetation, we calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery (available at 10-m resolution). NDVI is widely used for quantifying the health and density of vegetation by measuring how much light is reflected in the red and near-infrared spectral bands.

Green streets (i.e., with high NDVI values) have several benefits that encourage people to walk more, such as:

- providing shade and protection from the sun and heat,
- improving stormwater drainage to mitigate local flooding potential,
- and increasing the attractiveness of streets for walking.


For assessing blueness, we calculate water coverage based on the Sentinel Scene Classification Map (SCL). The water mask, with a value of 1, indicates areas covered by water during the specified time period.

The blue path has several benefits that enhance walkability, such as:

- aesthetic appeal of streets for pedestrians,
- moderating the temperature, especially during the warmer seasons,
- and providing a more relaxed walk, contributing to mental well-being and stress reduction.
