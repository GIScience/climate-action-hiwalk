How is 'greenness' calculated?

When estimating the greenness of a path, we consider the area within 10m of the path.
This captures the local environment that would be experienced by a person walking along the path.

For that area, we calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from satellite imagery.
NDVI is a widely-used metric for quantifying the health and density of vegetation.
It is calculated by measuring how much light is reflected and how much is absorbed in the red and near-infrared spectral bands.
