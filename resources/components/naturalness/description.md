How is 'Naturalness' calculated?

In its current version, Naturalness score each path accounting for the presence of vegetation (NDVI) and water bodies within 10 m from the center of a path or road, reflecting the environment perceived by pedestrians. Users have the option to focus the naturalness assessment on either vegetation (greenness) or on water (blueness).

For assessing vegetation, we calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery (available at 10-m resolution).

NDVI is a widely-used metric for quantifying the health and density of vegetation. It is calculated by measuring
how much light is reflected in the red and near-infrared spectral bands.

Green streets (i.e., with high NDVI values) have several benefits that encourage people to walk more, such as:
- providing shade and protection from the sun and heat,
- improving stormwater drainage to mitigate local flooding potential,
- and increasing the attractiveness of streets for walking.
