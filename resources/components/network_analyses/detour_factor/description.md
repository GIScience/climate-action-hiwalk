We define the detour factor as the average ratio between the actual walking distance through the path network and the distance in a straight line (i.e. Euclidean distance, aka "as the crow flies") from the center of each cell to its adjacent cells.

For each cell containing a path in the area of interest,
the detour factor is the average ratio of walking distance and Euclidian distance for all adjacent cells.

The minimum value, 1.0, indicates that all surrounding locations can be reached in a straight line. A value of 2.0 indicates that, on average, one must walk twice the straight line distance to the destinations. Missing Cells are cells for which no data could be optained, usually because there is no walkable paths within their area.
