Detour factors measure how directly you can walk to surrounding locations. The detour factor for a given cell is the average ratio between the walking distance and the straight-line (Euclidean) distance, i.e. “as the crow flies”, from the center of each cell to the center of adjacent cells. Cells without walkable paths are excluded from the calculation.

A detour factor of 1.0 indicates optimal connectivity, meaning that all neighboring cells can be reached by walking along a straight line. A value of 2.0 means that, on average, pedestrians must walk twice the straight-line distance, indicating a poorly connected path network.
