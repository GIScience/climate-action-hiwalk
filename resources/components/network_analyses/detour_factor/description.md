We define the detour factor as the average ratio between the actual walking distance through the path network and the distance in a straight line (i.e. Euclidean distance, aka "as the crow flies") from the center of each cell to its adjacent cells.

For each cell containing a path in the area of interest,
the detour is calculated as the average ragio of walking and euclidian distance for all adjacent cells.
