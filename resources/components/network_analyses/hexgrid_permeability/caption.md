How big of a detour must I take to reach my surroundings?

How many times longer you must walk compared to the straight line distance to the destination. The minimum value, 1.0, indicates that all surrounding locations can be reached in a straight line. A value of 2.0 indicates that, on average, one must walk twice the straight line distance to the destinations.
