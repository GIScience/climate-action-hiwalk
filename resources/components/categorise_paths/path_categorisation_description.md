The map categorises paths based on whether they are designated for use only by pedestrians or have to be shared with
either bicycles or, worse yet, motorised traffic. Paths that are designated for exclusive pedestrian (which include
sidewalks) use are typically safer and more comfortable while walking, while the opposite is true when pedestrians
have to share the road with other users, and in particular with fast motorised traffic.

hiWalk distinguished among the following categories (in decreasing Walkability value):
* Designated: designated footways exclusively for pedestrians (includes sidewalks).
* Shared with bikes: Footways shared with bikes, typically either a common foot and cycleway (VZ 240, in Germany) or footways where bikes are allowed to ride on (zVZ 1022-10, in Germany).
* Shared with slow cars: Streets without a sidewalk, with low speed limits, such as living streets or service ways.
* Shared with medium-speed cars: Streets without a sidewalk, with speed limits up to 30 km/h.
* Shared with fast cars: Streets without a sidewalk, with speed limits from 30 to 50 km/h.
* Shared with cars of unknown speed: Streets without a sidewalk, but speed limit is unknown.
* Not walkable: Paths where walking is forbidden (e.g. tunnels, private or military streets) or streets without a sidewalk and with speed limits higher than 50 km/h. Shown to explicitly highlight barriers.
* Unknown: Paths without enough information to categorise (for example, streets with no information about sidewalk presence)

Data come from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and the categorisation is based on OSM tags.
