Explanation of the different categories (from good to bad):
* Designated: designated footways exclusively for pedestrians.
* Designated shared with bikes: Footways shared with bikes, typically either a common foot and bikeway (VZ 240, in Germany) or footways where bikes are allowed to ride on (zVZ 1022-10, in Germany).
* Shared with motorized traffic low speed: Streets without a sidewalk, with low speed limits, such as living streets or service ways.
* Shared with motorized traffic medium speed: Streets without a sidewalk, with medium speed limits up to 30 km/h.
* Shared with motorized traffic high speed: Streets without a sidewalk, with higher speed limits up to 50 km/h.
* Not Walkable: Paths where walking is forbidden (e.g. tunnels, private or military streets) or streets without a sidewalk and with speed limits higher than 50 km/h. Shown to explicitly highlight barriers.
* Unknown: Paths that could not be fit in any of the above categories.

Data come from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and the categorisation is based on OSM tags.
