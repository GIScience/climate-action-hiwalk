Paths exclusively for pedestrians are safer and more comfortable than paths shared with bikes or, even worse, fast
motorised traffic. This indicator categorises paths according to which other users share space with pedestrians.

Categories (from better to worse):
* Designated: Paths exclusively for pedestrians (e.g., sidewalks).
* Shared with bikes: Paths where pedestrians share space with cyclists.
* Shared with cars up to 15 km/h: Streets without a sidewalk and with speed limits up to 15 km/h, such as living streets and service ways.
* Shared with cars up to 30 km/h: Streets without a sidewalk, with speed limits up to 30 km/h.
* Shared with cars up to 50 km/h: Streets without a sidewalk, with speed limits up to 50 km/h.
* Shared with cars above 50 km/h: Streets without a sidewalk and with speed limits higher than 50 km/h. Shown to explicitly highlight barriers
* Shared with cars of unknown speed: Streets without a sidewalk and with unknown speed limit.
* No access: Paths where walking is forbidden (e.g., tunnels, private or military streets).
* Unknown: Paths without enough information to categorise (e.g., streets with no information about sidewalk presence).

The categorisation is based on OpenStreetMap (OSM) tags.
