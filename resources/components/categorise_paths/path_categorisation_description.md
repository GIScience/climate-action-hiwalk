Paths exclusively for pedestrians are safer and more comfortable than paths shared with bikes or, even worse, fast
motorised traffic. This indicator categorises paths according to which other users share space with pedestrians.

Path categories that pedestrians share with others (from better to worse):
* Pedestrians Exclusive: Paths exclusively for pedestrians (e.g., sidewalks).
* Bikes: Paths where pedestrians share space with cyclists.
* Cars up to 15 km/h: Streets without a sidewalk and with speed limits up to 15 km/h, such as living streets and service ways.
* Cars up to 30 km/h: Streets without a sidewalk, with speed limits up to 30 km/h.
* Cars up to 50 km/h: Streets without a sidewalk, with speed limits up to 50 km/h.
* Cars above 50 km/h: Streets without a sidewalk and with speed limits higher than 50 km/h. Shown to explicitly highlight barriers
* Cars of unknown speed: Streets without a sidewalk and with unknown speed limit.
* Unknown: Paths without enough information to categorise (e.g., streets with no information about sidewalk presence).

The categorisation is based on OpenStreetMap (OSM) tags.
