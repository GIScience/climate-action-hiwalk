How smooth is my path?
This map categorises paths based on their smoothness. Walking on very smooth paths is possible with e.g. wheelchairs or strollers, while walking on paths categorised as 'very bad' is not possible with wheelchairs or strollers and may require sturdy shoes or may even be dangerous.

A full explanation of the individual categories can be found in the description below.
