A path's surface quality refers to how safe and comfortable it is for walking. A smooth, solid surface is especially important for people with limited mobility, as well as for those using wheelchairs, walking frames, or prams/strollers.

The indicator infers surface quality based on the `smoothness`, `surface`, and `tracktype` tags in OpenStreetMap. The `smoothness` tag is the most relevant for surface quality, but it is only sparsely mapped. We therefore use the `surface` tag (which describes the surface's _material_, such as asphalt or cobblestone) and the `tracktype` tag (which describes the surface's firmness and maintenance condition) when smoothness data is missing. Certain surface materials are generally too bumpy (e.g., cobblestones) or difficult to walk (e.g., sand). For many other materials, such as asphalt or paving stones, the actual surface quality depends on how well the path is maintained. In cases where only the surface tag is available, we assume the path is well maintained by default. These classes are marked with the prefix “Potentially” (e.g., “Potentially Good”) to reflect uncertainty regarding the actual condition.

The following tables show the exact mapping of `smoothness`, `surface`, and `tracktype` tag values to surface quality values.
