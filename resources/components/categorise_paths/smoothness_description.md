Explanation of the different smoothness categories from best to worst:
* Good: Paths with a smooth surface such as concrete or asphalt that can be used with wheelchairs and strollers without problems.
* Mediocre: Either paved paths that show more signs of wear (like larger surface cracks and/or potholes), or the best quality unpaved roads. Still usable with wheelchairs and strollers.
* Poor: Paths which are heavily damaged paved roads or good but not pristine unpaved roads. May not be usable with wheelchairs or strollers, but does not require sturdy hiking boots.
* Very Poor: Paths which require sturdy hiking boots and may even be dangerous or impassable.
* Unknown: Paths for which there is no smoothness information

Data come from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and the categorisation is based on OSM smoothness tags.
