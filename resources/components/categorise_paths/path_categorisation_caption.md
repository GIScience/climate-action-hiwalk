Who do I have to share this path with?

This map presents a categorisation of walkable paths based on whether they are only for pedestrians or shared with bicycles or motorised traffic. Paths that are designated for exclusive pedestrian use are generally better in terms of safety and comfort while walking, while the opposite is true when pedestrians have to share the road with fast motorised traffic.

A full explanation of the individual categories can be found in the description below.
